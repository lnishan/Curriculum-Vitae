  - An audience-sourced Connect6 game hosted on Twitch.  
Components: (1) FingRRR, a multithreaded interaction framework built on top of OpenCV. (2) TwitchPlaysAPI, an IRC bot that communicates with IRC servers. (3) MyConnectAI, a Connect6 AI I designed from scratch.

- [FormMgr](http://lnishan.net/FormMgr/)
  - `HTML5`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, `MySQL`, `Web Development`
  - A simple and easy-to-use form management system for organizations. It allows users to validate fields with custom regular expressions. I utilized HTML5 native drag-and-drop and JavaScript for extensive DOM manipulations.
